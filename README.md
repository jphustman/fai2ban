Instead of just overwriting my fresh fail2ban confs with the files from
fail2ban.de (https://forum.blocklist.de/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=63&p=159) I
figured I'd do a smart diff on them and make a default to use on a new
Debian Jessie 8 installation.

The etc/ folder is what is in the file from blocklist

The server-default is directly from a new apt-get install failban on a
fresh Debian 8 install.
